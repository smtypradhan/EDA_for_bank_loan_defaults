📊 Exploratory Data Analysis: Bank Loan Default Risk
🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a bank loan dataset to identify patterns and factors associated with loan defaults. The goal is to help financial institutions understand borrower risk and make more informed lending decisions.

The analysis examines borrower demographics, financial attributes, and loan characteristics to uncover trends linked to default behavior.


🧠 Business Problem

Banks face significant financial losses due to loan defaults.
By understanding which customer and loan features are associated with higher default risk, banks can:

Improve credit approval strategies

Optimize interest rates

Reduce non-performing assets


🗂️ Dataset Summary

The dataset contains information related to:

Applicant income

Loan amount and term

Credit history

Employment and demographic attributes

Loan repayment status (default / non-default)


🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook


🔎 Key Analysis Steps

Data cleaning and missing value handling

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Distribution analysis of numerical variables

Default rate comparison across customer segments

Correlation analysis between key financial variables


📈 Key Insights

Applicants with poor or missing credit history show a significantly higher default rate.

Lower income groups tend to default more frequently compared to higher-income borrowers.

Certain loan terms and amounts exhibit higher default concentration.

Credit history emerges as one of the strongest indicators of repayment behavior.


💡 Business Recommendations

Strengthen credit history checks during loan approval.

Introduce risk-based pricing for higher-risk applicants.

Use borrower segmentation to tailor loan products.

Flag high-risk profiles for manual review.


🚀 Future Work

Build a predictive model to classify loan default risk

Address class imbalance using resampling techniques

Perform feature importance analysis

Extend analysis with time-based repayment behavior
